        <div class="about">
    	    
	        <p>Government Titumir College (Bengali: সরকারি তিতুমীর কলেজ) is one of the greatest public educational institutions in Bangladesh. In terms of student number it is one of the largest college in the World. It is located on the A.K. Khandakar Road in the posh area of Gulshan, Dhaka. This college is named after Mir Nesar Ali Titumir, the first martyr in the struggle for liberation in the subcontinent.It is affiliated with the University of Dhaka.<br>This college was established on 7 May 1968, by a group of enthusiastic and dynamic people. Then it was named ‘Jinnah College’. In the turbulent days of Non Co-operation Movement on 3 March 1971, this college was named after the name of Shahid Titumir, erasing the name of Jinnah. This was done on the eve of the meeting of Maolana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Paltan Maidan. It was led by the important central member of “the Student Action Committee” and student of this College Colonel Md. Abdus Salam (Rtd), Bir Pratik accompanied by some other students. It is obviously very significant to name the college after the name of a brave and dedicated leader during the turbulent hours of our great struggle for liberation.</p>
